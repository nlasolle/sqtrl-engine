# SPARQL Query Transformation Rule Language - Engine

This tool has been designed to manage flexible search with the SPARQL query language.
SPARQL is the W3C recommanded language to query RDF graphs. 

The proposed tool relies on the definition and application of transformation rules
 in order to perform query transformation.
It can be used with any RDF graph and thus allows to perform approximation and relaxation.

# Installation and configuration guide
